  Dev Null here. I am here to contribute to some open source projects while
learning and refining some software development skills. I would like to
work on software reverse engineering and debugging frameworks and tools but I
also have an interest in kernel and driver development. With that said, I
still enjoy writing and working on application level code bases.
